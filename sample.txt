Artificial intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science that aims to create machines that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence. Some common applications of AI include natural language processing, machine learning, and robotics. AI systems are designed to analyze large amounts of data and make predictions or decisions based on that analysis.
